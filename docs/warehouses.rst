Warehouse Administration
========================

To create a new warehouse, go to *admin>Add Warehouse*.

There are two kinds of warehouses in Item Hut, B&M, which is a warehouse where you control all aspects of inventory, and 3PL, which is a 3rd party warehouse.

B&M
---

A B&M warehouse allows you to create, add, and delete pallet and picking locations. You will also be allowed to create, add, delete, and move pallets.

You will also be allowed to do outbound QC. Inbound QC will be added later. The logging mechanisms do not function properly at this time.

3PL
---

A 3PL warehouse will only allow you to add products and view running inventory.
