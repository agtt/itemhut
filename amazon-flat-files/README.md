#Amazon Flat Files

Amazon flat files are the main way of "speaking" to amazon, either throug manual or API uploads. They change often and tend to be deprecated quickly.

For right now, only US files are included. You can also use these files to maintain FBA listing.

I have not included the browse tree guides, which wile not strictly needed for successful uploads, do add enhancments to your listings.
